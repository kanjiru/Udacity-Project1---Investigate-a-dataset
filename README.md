# Udacity-Project1---Investigate-a-dataset

# Project Overview
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Process 
* Step 1 - Choose a dataset i.e **Movie Database (TMDb)**.
* Step 2 - Use jupyter notebooks to organise the python code into cells posing questions for analysis.
* Step 3 - Analyse the data by wrangling and cleaning the data.
* Step 4 - Share findings of the questions posed previously.


### Dataset Description
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The **Movie Database (TMDb)**, including user ratings and revenue.The column names include id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cas,t homepage, director, tagline, keywords, overview, runtime, genres, production_companies, release_date, vote_count, vote_average, release_year, budget_adj and revenue_adj. The columns can be used to identify trends in the consumption of movies in regards to the entertainment industry.This information when analysed (e.g revenue and popularity) could be used to drive up profit margins or identify the most important variables to considered while making films ensuring effectivenes and efficiency in their production.
